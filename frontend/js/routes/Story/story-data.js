    body: `I grew up in Indianapolis in a very modest home, several of them actually. Growing up my family lived in almost 20 different
    houses before I turned 18. Moving from house to house & living in poverty taught me many valuable lessons. Going to 3 different school
    districts gave me a lot of perspective about how different life can be, even when you live so close. I went to Wayne Township schools,
    Indianapolis Public Schools, and Decatur Township Schools. Growing up like taught me the value of a dollar, how to stretch money, but
    most of all it taught me how much of a privledge it is to grow up in a stable home. Later in life I would make it my life's goal to be
    able to provide a stable home for my future children.

    body: `My first steps on the web were of social neccessity. MySpace, the first website I can remember ever visiting,
    was great for it's social enrichment but I can retrospectively say that the biggest impact it had on my life was
    in a little feature where they allowed you to edit the layout of your profile. Here is where I learned the basics
    of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At this time I didn't know how far that knowledge would carry me.

    body: `
      In early 2011 I discovered a little indie game called Minecraft. After several hundred hours in single player, and
      even more in multiplayer, I wanted to start my own server. This endeavor is where I learned the basics of network
      communication, the bash command line, and many other valuable skills. The real learning, however, came when I wanted
      to create my own multiplayer plugins to customize my server. At the time Bukkit was the leading open source multiplayer
      server for Minecraft and it had an API with decent documentation. This is where I learned Java, object oriented programming,
      and started digging deep into algorithms and the complicated math around player position and monster movement. Throughout
      high school, I continued learning and developing my skills in Java.

    It was DeveloperTown.

    employee had a little shed on wheels that could be moved around to accomidate ever-changing teams, projects, etc. At DeveloperTown
    I met Jon Nolen, who I would look to as a teacher and mentor for the years to come. I showed off some of my Java code, took an NDA home
    to my parents, and started my very first javascript project in Angular. For the next few months I would continue as an unpaid intern,
    until offered a job as a paid intern early in the summer. I worked at DeveloperTown full time until May of 2017.

    body: ` In August of 2016, at a company-wide team meeting, one of the owners of DeveloperTown introduced a new company that would exist outside of DT
    called DT Starts. This company would look back on the roots of DeveloperTown and work with startups to trade hours for equity and exist as the
    techincal co-founder. I got to know a few of the employees of DeveloperTown who had moved to DT Starts and I asked for a transfer. DeveloperTown was happy
    to oblige. After working there for a couple of months I ended up securing a spot as a full time software engineer. At this time I dropped out of college 
    to pursue a career doing startups. This is where I have leveled up the most in my career. I started in React but was quickly asked to expand my knowledge to other
    pieces of application development. I spent extended lengths of time working in Node.js, doing Dev Ops, working with co-founders to make architectual decisions, creating
    several data models, and even architecting entire systems that are in production today. So far I've helped co-found 13 companies with DT Starts.

    While I didn't experience the risk the founders had, I was able to experience the early formations of a company - knowing how to build processes & build a team, it was time for
    me to move on to solve something that was holding me back. When a company was ready for scale, I didn't have the answers. I had never worked in a company of more than 40 people.
    This is where Swarm Solutions comes in - with Swarm I have been able to experience working in companies with thousands of employees and millions of users. This experience has been
    invaluable on my quest to become to the best software engineer that I can be.
